## Project Status 🎉
As of May 2, 2025, the project has made significant progress. The core repository, Convex backend, and basic frontend structure are in place. Key implementations include:
- Repository initialization with Git and proper configuration
- Basic Convex setup with schema, authentication, and core game functions
- Initial frontend scaffolding with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Game creation, joining, move making, and basic game listing functionality
- Initial UI components for the game board and game list

Many tasks remain for enhanced features, animations, UI polish, testing, and deployment.

## Overview
TicTacToe Remix is a real-time, multiplayer version of Tic Tac Toe that supports 3-4 players with larger boards (4x4 for 3 players, 5x5 for 4 players). The app features enhanced interactivity, modern UI/UX, and learning-focused elements. It's built with React, Convex, Tailwind CSS, and various animation/UI libraries.

## UI Architecture & Visual Design

### Hybrid Component Strategy
- **ShadCn UI**: Used for foundational, accessible, and composable components (e.g., Button, Input, Dialog, Menu).
- **lucide-react**: Used for all iconography (player markers, status indicators, navigation, etc.).
- **Custom Atomic Components**: Built for game-specific or highly unique UI needs (e.g., animated player markers, custom game cards, celebratory overlays).
- **React Bits**: Used for playful, animated, and celebratory effects (see table below for mapping).
- **Framer Motion**: Used for smooth transitions and custom animation logic.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first styling and theming.

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** #7C3AED (Violet 600, Tailwind)
- **Secondary:** #F59E42 (Orange 400, Tailwind)
- **Success:** #10B981 (Emerald 500, Tailwind)
- **Warning:** #FBBF24 (Amber 400, Tailwind)
- **Error:** #EF4444 (Red 500, Tailwind)
- **Background:** #F3F4F6 (Gray 100, Tailwind)
- **Surface:** #F3F4F6 (Gray 100, Tailwind; light mode, gentle/low-glare) / #1F2937 (Gray 800, for dark mode)
- **Text:** #111827 (Gray 900, Tailwind) / #F9FAFB (Gray 50, for dark mode)
- **Gradients:** Violet → Blue, Orange → Pink (for backgrounds and animated elements)

> Note: Light mode uses a gentle, low-glare gray background (#F3F4F6) for surface elements instead of pure white, to reduce eye strain and improve comfort.

### Accessibility & Theming
- All interactive elements are keyboard navigable and ARIA-labeled.
- All animated elements respect reduced motion settings.
- High-contrast mode and light/dark mode supported via a global theme provider.

### Rationale
- Avoid deep coupling to any single UI library for flexibility and open-source friendliness.
- Ensure accessibility, maintainability, and playful, modern design.
