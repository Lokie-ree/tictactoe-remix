## Project Status
As of May 1, 2023, the project has made significant progress. The core repository, Convex backend, and basic frontend structure are in place. Key implementations include:
- Repository initialization with Git and proper configuration
- Basic Convex setup with schema, authentication, and core game functions
- Initial frontend scaffolding with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Game creation, joining, move making, and basic game listing functionality
- Initial UI components for the game board and game list

Many tasks remain for enhanced features, animations, UI polish, testing, and deployment.

## Overview
TicTacToe Remix is a real-time, multiplayer version of Tic Tac Toe that supports 3-4 players with larger boards (4x4 for 3 players, 5x5 for 4 players). The app features enhanced interactivity, modern UI/UX, and learning-focused elements. It's built with React, Convex, Tailwind CSS, and various animation/UI libraries.
