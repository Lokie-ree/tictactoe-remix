## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: TicTacToe Remix
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

TicTacToe Remix is a web-based game that reimagines the classic Tic Tac Toe experience by expanding it to support 3-4 players. Unlike traditional Tic Tac Toe which is limited to a 3x3 grid and two players, this version offers larger game boards (4x4 for 3 players, 5x5 for 4 players) and adjusts winning conditions based on player count.

The application uses Convex as its backend to provide real-time updates and synchronization of game state across all players. Users can create new games, join existing ones, and compete with others in real-time.

## 1.3 Enhanced Interactivity and Visual Appeal

To align with modern learning game principles and create a more engaging experience, the following features are planned:

- **Animated Game Board**: Smooth transitions for marker placement, turn changes, and win/draw highlights.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Hover/tap previews, cell highlights, and celebratory effects for wins/draws.
- **Move History & Exploration**: Timeline to review previous moves and board states; sandbox mode for experimentation.
- **Guided Learning Mode**: Challenge puzzles, tiered hints, and post-game explanations to foster learning by doing.
- **Onboarding & Tutorials**: Interactive walkthrough for new users, explaining rules and mechanics.
- **Mini-Quizzes & Reflections**: Quick quizzes and prompts after games to reinforce learning and encourage reflection.
- **Custom Avatars & Colors**: Player customization for avatars and marker colors, with animated turn indicators.
- **Visual Storytelling**: Progress bars, victory/draw screens, and fun UI elements to create a narrative arc.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Sound effects, subtle animations, and easter eggs for delight.
- **Achievements & Rewards**: Badges, streaks, and stats to motivate continued play and mastery.
