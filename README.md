## Architecture & Tech Stack

### System Overview
- 💻 **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS
- 🗄️ **Backend:** Convex (database, real-time sync, auth)
- 🔐 **Authentication:** Convex Auth (anonymous)
- ☁️ **Deployment:** Convex Cloud (backend), Vercel/Netlify (frontend, optional)

### Key Libraries
- 🎞️ **Framer Motion:** Advanced UI animations and transitions
- 🧩 **Radix UI:** Accessible, unstyled UI primitives (dialogs, menus, popovers)
- ✨ **React-bits:** Flashy, visually engaging components for onboarding, achievements, etc.
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for rapid, responsive design
- 🔔 **Heroicons/Phosphor Icons:** Iconography

### Architecture Pattern
- 🔄 **Real-time Client-Server:** All game state and logic reside in Convex; frontend subscribes for updates.

### Database Schema (Convex)
- 📄 **games:** id, status, playerCount, boardSize, currentTurn, moves[], createdAt, updatedAt
- 👤 **players:** id, gameId, userId, color, avatar, lastActive
- 📝 **moves:** id, gameId, playerId, position, turnNumber, timestamp

---

## Game Rules & Mechanics

- 👥 **Player Count:** 3 (4x4 board) or 4 (5x5 board)
- 🏆 **Win Condition:**
  - 3-in-a-row (3 players)
  - 4-in-a-row (4 players)
- 🔄 **Turns:** Sequential, enforced by backend
- 🚫 **Move Restrictions:** Only empty cells, only on your turn
- 🏁 **Game End:** Win (row/col/diagonal) or draw (board full, no winner)
- 🔌 **Disconnects:** 30s to reconnect, then turn is skipped
- ⏮️ **Move History:** All moves are logged; players can review and experiment during the game
- 🧪 **Sandbox Mode:** Step through move history and try alternate moves (does not affect live game)

## UI/UX & Animation Libraries

### UI Libraries
- 🧩 **ShadCn UI:** For foundational, accessible, composable components (Button, Input, Dialog, Menu)
- ✨ **React Bits:** For playful, animated, and celebratory UI (onboarding, achievements, win/draw, etc.)
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and layout
- 🖼️ **lucide-react:** For all iconography (player markers, status indicators, navigation, etc.)

### Animation
- 🎞️ **Framer Motion:**
  - Marker placement (scale/fade)
  - Turn transitions (slide/pulse)
  - Win/draw highlights (color pulse/confetti)
  - Move history transitions
  - Onboarding/tutorial overlays
  - Micro-interactions (button presses, hover/tap feedback)
- ✨ **React Bits:**
  - Animated backgrounds (Aurora, Hyperspeed, Ball Pit, etc.)
  - Animated lists, cards, counters, and celebratory overlays
  - Subtle, always-on effects for gameplay; over-the-top, skippable effects for celebrations
- 🔊 **Sound Effects:** (e.g., Howler.js or use-sound) for moves, wins, achievements

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** #7C3AED (Violet 600, Tailwind)
- **Secondary:** #F59E42 (Orange 400, Tailwind)
- **Success:** #10B981 (Emerald 500, Tailwind)
- **Warning:** #FBBF24 (Amber 400, Tailwind)
- **Error:** #EF4444 (Red 500, Tailwind)
- **Background:** #F3F4F6 (Gray 100, Tailwind)
- **Surface:** #F3F4F6 (Gray 100, Tailwind; light mode, gentle/low-glare) / #1F2937 (Gray 800, for dark mode)
- **Text:** #111827 (Gray 900, Tailwind) / #F9FAFB (Gray 50, for dark mode)
- **Gradients:** Violet → Blue, Orange → Pink (for backgrounds and animated elements)

> Note: Light mode uses a gentle, low-glare gray background (#F3F4F6) for surface elements instead of pure white, to reduce eye strain and improve comfort.

### Accessibility
- ⌨️ All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- 🌀 Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- 🟦 High color contrast and ARIA labels for screen readers
- High-contrast mode and light/dark mode supported via a global theme provider
